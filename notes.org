Lift the curse of King Midas before his sanity fails him.

Puzzle/roguelike where you move Midas through random levels as all he touches turns to gold. The more gold he touches, the more madness he gains.

* Ideas
- Something to reduce madness (eating food when not cursed?)
- Turning a tile gold slowly increases madness
- Revisiting golden tiles quickly increases madness
- Pushing blocks turns them gold
- Some tiles that are immune to gold
- Potions for brief respite from gold
- Delusion which makes Midas colorblind
- Hit creatures until they have no hearts/shields then they are turned into gold
- Is the aim of the game to get as much gold as possible without going mad?
- Place multiple exits so that there is almost always a solution?
- Gold rush, zoom along tiles until blocked
- Throw gold coins at enemies
- Coin pouch bombs?
- Golden weapons
- Philosopher's stone allows reversing of the process
- The curse only kicks in after a certain point?
- Bonus for painting the entire room gold
- Seeds for consistent runs
- Deal more damage when closer to insane
- Clearing a level reduces madness
- Play down to Hades (Charon + styx to underworld)
- When cursed deal more damage but increase madness
- When uncursed deal less damage but don't increase madness
- When madness is full the entire world turns to gold and every step deals damage rather than madness
- Pushable mirror for taking out medusa?
- Hide hearts when enemy is not aggressive
- 1 weapon slot
  - weapon always shows targeting indicator and a does attack
- 1 item slot
  - some items are passive
  - active items can be triggered with space
  - items and weapons can have cooldowns
- when sanity runs out incoming damage is 2x and output damage is 2x
- pushing objects onto the stairs sends them up/down
- effect tiles that respond to pushed objects
- monsters that leave a trail of slime/blood/posion?
- cash in golden statues at the end of each level, get 2x coins if they are on a golden tile
- get the blessing of a god at the start? or at a temple along the way?
